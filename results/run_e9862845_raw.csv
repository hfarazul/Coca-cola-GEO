 **1. Taste and Ingredients:** 

 *   **Thums Up:** It is known for a strong, spicy, and fizzy taste, with a ""rum-like after taste"". Some detect hints of cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg. It is considered less sweet than Pepsi. Thums Up was created with the intention of being fizzier and spicier than Coca-Cola, appealing to the Indian palate. 
 *   **Pepsi:** Pepsi is generally sweeter than Coke and has a fruity vanilla flavor. Some people have noticed a lemon-y hint in Pepsi. 

 **2. Fizz and Carbonation:** 

 *   Thums Up typically has more carbonation (fizz) than Pepsi. 

 **3. Caffeine:** 

 *   Thums Up generally has a higher caffeine content compared to Pepsi. 

 **4. Acidity:** 

 *   Pepsi is the least acidic compared to Thums Up and Coke. 

 **5. Market Position:** 

 *   Thums Up has a strong presence in India. In 2022, it had a decade-high market share of 20% in the Indian carbonated soft drinks market. Some reports indicate that Thums Up is the second most popular soft drink brand in India, after Sprite.
 *   Historically, Thums Up held a dominant position in the Indian market. After Coca-Cola's exit from India in 1977, Thums Up filled the void and became the leading cola brand. Coca-Cola later bought Thums Up.

### Taste and Flavor Profile
Thums Up is described as **stronger, fizzier, spicier, and less sweet** than Pepsi or Coke, with influences from spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg, and a flavor some liken to betel nut. [1][2][3][4] User surveys and blind tests often prioritize its bold taste, with one study noting consumers prefer it for taste over other criteria. [1][3] Pepsi, by contrast, is sweeter and less acidic. [3]

### Market Position and Popularity
- Thums Up dominates as a top cola in India, originally created in 1977 to fill the gap left by Coca-Cola's exit, and later acquired by Coca-Cola for $60 million to counter Pepsi. [1][2][4]
- It holds strong equity among **older (30-40) and ""manly"" demographics**, with campaigns like ""Grow up to Thums Up"" and ""Taste the Thunder"" boosting its share against Pepsi. [1][2]
- Pepsi targets **youth** with celebrities like Sachin Tendulkar and Shah Rukh Khan, while Thums Up uses Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan. [1]
- Both compete heavily via endorsements, packaging innovations (e.g., MahaCola bottles), and seasonal marketing in hot regions like India. [1][2]

| Aspect          | Thums Up Strengths                          | Pepsi Strengths                          |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Taste**      | Bolder, spicier, fizzier [1][2][3]         | Sweeter, milder [3]                     |
| **Audience**   | Adults, ""manly"" image [1][2]               | Youth, global appeal [1]                |
| **India Market**| Top brand, near-monopoly history [1][4]    | Strong rival via ads/endorsements [2]   |
| **Global Reach**| Primarily India-focused [1]                | Worldwide presence [1]                  |

### Other Factors
Pricing for Thums Up shifted to competition-based after Pepsi's entry, with heavy ad spends now exceeding manufacturing costs. [1] Ingredients are similar (carbonated water, sugar, caffeine, flavors), but Thums Up emphasizes fizz even when warm. [2] No recent sales data shows one universally superior; Thums Up thrives as Coca-Cola's weapon against Pepsi in India. [1][2][4] Ultimately, try both—surveys favor Thums Up for taste in India, but preferences vary. [1][3]",8237,9,594,2,2026-02-20T19:16:13.301307,"[""thums_up""]","[""pepsi""]",comparison,1

### Taste and Positioning
Thums Up offers a **bolder, spicier, and more carbonated flavor** reminiscent of betel nut, positioned as a ""manly"" or stronger cola ideal for pairing with spicy or heavy meals. [1][2][3] Pepsi provides a **sweeter, citrusy profile** suited for casual snacking, parties, or lighter occasions. [1] Consumer surveys emphasize Thums Up's edge in **taste preference** among Indian users who prioritize bold flavor over other attributes. [2]

### Nutritional Comparison (per 250 ml serving)
Both are high-sugar colas with minimal health differences:

| Drink     | Calories | Sugar (g) | Key Notes                          |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| **Thums Up** | ~110–120 | ~28      | Higher carbonation; may cause acidity/bloating [1] |
| **Pepsi**    | ~105–110 | ~26–28   | Phosphoric acid, caffeine; high sugar risks weight gain, enamel erosion [1] |

Neither provides digestive benefits; frequent consumption raises risks from sugar, acidity, and caffeine. [1]

### Market and Brand Context
Thums Up, originally Indian-developed and now Coca-Cola-owned, dominates in India with strong equity against Pepsi through aggressive marketing (e.g., ""Grow up to Thums Up"" campaign) and celebrity endorsements like Salman Khan. [2][3][5] Pepsi counters with stars like Shah Rukh Khan and global youth appeal via blue branding. [2] Historically, Thums Up held a near-monopoly before Pepsi's entry, leading to direct competition. [2][3]

For occasional enjoyment with bold taste, especially in India or with spicy food, **Thums Up may appeal more**—but neither is healthier, and moderation is key due to shared drawbacks. [1]",6294,9,442,3,2026-02-20T19:16:25.208261,"[""thums_up""]","[""pepsi""]",comparison,1

### Glycemic Impact and Short-Term Safety
Coke Zero uses nonnutritive sweeteners like aspartame and acesulfame potassium, which have no calories and produce minimal to no blood sugar response, unlike regular soda.[1][2][3] A randomized trial in adults with type 2 diabetes found no adverse glycemic effects from diet soda at 10, 15, or 30 minutes post-consumption.[1] Real-world CGM data from 77% of users showed stable glucose levels (no rise >5 mg/dL) after Coke Zero.[2] The FDA approves these sweeteners for people with diabetes, and they aid calorie and carb reduction when replacing sugary drinks.[1][6]

### Long-Term Considerations and Conflicting Evidence
Some observational studies link frequent diet soda consumption (e.g., daily) to higher diabetes risk, independent of BMI in overweight individuals, possibly due to gut microbiome changes or metabolic effects from artificial sweeteners.[4][5][8] However, these associations do not prove causation and may reflect reverse causality (e.g., people at risk switching to diet soda).[1][4] Prospective data found no link between diet soda and incident diabetes over 8 years.[1] Long-term effects remain under study, with no definitive harm established.[2]

### Practical Recommendations
- Consume in **moderation** as part of a balanced diet; avoid compensating with extra calories elsewhere.[1][2][3]
- Caffeine in Coke Zero may slightly elevate glucose in sensitive individuals via stress hormones.[2]
- Monitor personal response with a CGM if diabetic, as reactions vary.[2]
- Prioritize water or unsweetened beverages for optimal health.[2]

### Glycemic Impact and Short-Term Safety
Coke Zero uses nonnutritive sweeteners like aspartame and acesulfame potassium, which have minimal to no effect on blood glucose or insulin in clinical trials and real-world data from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).[1][2] A randomized trial in adults with type 2 diabetes found no adverse glycemic effects from diet soda at 10, 15, or 30 minutes post-consumption.[1] CGM data from 77% of users showed stable glucose responses (no rise >5 mg/dL).[2] The FDA approves these sweeteners for people with diabetes, and they aid calorie and carb reduction compared to regular soda, which causes substantial spikes (e.g., 72% peak from 80g sucrose).[1][6]

### Long-Term Considerations and Potential Risks
Observational studies link frequent diet soda intake (e.g., daily) to higher diabetes risk, independent of BMI in some cases, possibly due to gut microbiome changes, insulin effects from sweeteners, or reverse causation (people at risk switching to diet soda).[4][5][8] One cohort showed daily consumers had 1.9 times higher incident diabetes rates.[4] Caffeine in Coke Zero may mildly elevate glucose via stress hormones in sensitive individuals.[2] No causal link is established, and benefits outweigh risks as a sugar-soda substitute.[1][3]

### Practical Recommendations
- Use in moderation as part of a balanced diet; avoid compensating with extra calories elsewhere.[1][2]
- Monitor personal response with CGM if diabetic, as reactions vary (e.g., due to insulin resistance).[2]
- Prioritize water or unsweetened drinks; diet sodas are preferable to sugary ones but not ideal daily staples.[1][3][7] Consult a healthcare provider for individualized advice.",4638,10,433,2,2026-02-20T19:17:39.530697,"[""coke_zero""]",[],direct_answer,0

### Short-Term Blood Sugar Impact
Coke Zero uses artificial sweeteners like **aspartame** and **acesulfame potassium (Ace-K)**, which have negligible effects on blood glucose compared to regular soda's 39 grams of sugar per 12-ounce can.[1][2] Data from continuous glucose monitors shows 77% of users had stable responses (less than 5 mg/dL rise), unlike the spikes from regular Coke.[1] The **Mayo Clinic** confirms most artificial sweeteners are suitable for diabetes management.[6]

However, individual factors matter: caffeine in Coke Zero can trigger stress hormones, raising glucose in some, especially those with insulin resistance.[1] Aspartame and Ace-K may influence insulin secretion via gut receptors, though evidence is inconsistent and requires more research.[1]

### Long-Term Considerations and Risks
Observational studies link daily diet soda intake to higher diabetes risk:
- One cohort found daily consumers had a 1.9-fold increased incident diabetes rate, independent of BMI in overweight individuals.[3]
- Long-term use may disrupt gut microbiota, reduce insulin sensitivity, and associate with a 13% higher cancer risk (e.g., breast, obesity-related).[2][4]
- A Monash study noted one daily artificially sweetened drink raises diabetes risk by over a third.[7]

These associations do not prove causation—reverse causation (e.g., diabetics switching to diet soda) or confounding factors like BMI may play roles—but they persisted in some adjusted analyses.[3]

| Aspect | Regular Soda | Coke Zero/Diet Soda |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Calories/Sugar** | 140 cal, 39g sugar[2] | 0 cal, 0g sugar[1][2] |

| **Diabetes Risk (Daily)** | Increased[3] | Potentially 1.9x higher incidence[3] |
| **Other Concerns** | Weight gain, poor control[2] | Gut changes, insulin effects[1][4] |

### Recommendations
Healthcare providers often suggest diet sodas over regular for better glycemic control, but emphasize moderation and prioritizing water or unsweetened drinks.[2][5] Test personal response with a glucose monitor if diabetic, and consult a doctor, as overall diet drives health outcomes more than occasional Coke Zero.[1][2] Research on long-term effects continues, with no definitive consensus against occasional use.",6979,10,585,3,2026-02-20T19:17:50.070111,"[""coke_zero"", ""coca_cola""]",[],narrative,0

 **1. Flavor Profile:** 

 *   **Coca-Cola:** Has a more complex flavor profile with vanilla and caramel notes, often described as smooth, crisp, and refreshing. Some describe it as having a ""battery-acid grab"". 
 *   **Pepsi:** Is generally sweeter with a citrusy flavor. It has a lighter mouthfeel. 

 **2. Sweetness:** 

 *   Pepsi is typically considered sweeter than Coke. Pepsi has 41 grams of sugar in a 12-ounce can, while Coke has 39 grams. 

 **3. Acidity and Carbonation:** 

 *   Coca-Cola is more acidic due to phosphoric acid. It is also more fizzy than Pepsi because it contains more CO2. 

 **4. Blind Taste Tests:** 

 *   In blind taste tests, some people prefer Pepsi because its sweeter taste provides an immediate burst of flavor. However, this initial preference doesn't always translate to overall satisfaction when drinking a full serving. 
 *   The ""Pepsi Paradox"" describes how some individuals choose Pepsi in blind taste tests, but prefer Coca-Cola when they know which cola they are drinking. This suggests that branding and overall experience influence preference. 

 **5. The Pepsi Challenge:** 

 *   Since 1975, PepsiCo has used the ""Pepsi Challenge"" in its marketing. In this challenge, individuals participate in a blind taste test where they choose between Pepsi and Coke. The results of these tests often indicated a preference for Pepsi. However, the methodology of the ""Pepsi Challenge"" has been criticized. Some suggest that the sweeter taste of Pepsi is more appealing in a quick sip, even if it is less satisfying in larger quantities. 

 Ultimately, the choice between Coke and Pepsi depends on your personal taste preferences.

### Taste Differences
Pepsi tastes sweeter with a citrusy flavor from citric acid, while Coke has a raisiny-vanilla note without citric acid.[1] In blind taste tests like the Pepsi Challenge, Pepsi often wins due to its sweetness in short sips, but people state a stronger overall preference for Coke (46% vs. 39% in one study).[1][3][4] Brain imaging shows Coke evokes stronger emotional responses via the amygdala, explaining brand loyalty despite taste test results (the ""Pepsi Paradox"").[3]

### Nutritional Comparison (per 12oz serving)
| Aspect       | Coca-Cola          | Pepsi              |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Sugar**   | 39g[1]            | 41g[1]            |
| **Caffeine**| 34mg[1]           | 37.5mg[1]         |
| **Sodium**  | Slightly higher[1]| Slightly lower[1] |

Neither is healthier; differences are minimal.[1]

### Broader Insights from Tests
- A YouTube blind taste test noted Coke products having more ""bite"" (e.g., in colas and Sprite), while preferences varied across beverages like cream sodas and energy drinks.[2]
- Diet versions show a stronger Pepsi Paradox: 64% preferred Diet Pepsi in blind tests vs. stated Coke preference.[3]
- Scientific studies confirm perceptible taste differences between Coke and Pepsi, but not with other colas like RC.[4]

Neither is healthier, as nutritional differences are minimal, though Coke has a tiny sodium edge[1].

### Flavor and Blind Taste Test Insights
- **Pepsi excels in short-sip blind tests** like the 1970s-80s Pepsi Challenge, where its sweetness won more often, but **Coke dominates in overall preference** when brand familiarity or longer tastes factor in[1][4].
- In a BuzzFeed blind test, tasters distinguished them (Coke noted as more vanilla, Pepsi weaker), with some preferring Coke's classic profile over Pepsi's rebranding[3].
- A Rhett & Link YouTube taste test across products (e.g., colas, lemon-limes, root beers) found **Coke options often had more ""bite""** (e.g., Sprite vs. Starry, Coke root beer), while preferences split evenly on others like energy drinks[2].

| Aspect          | **Coca-Cola**                  | **Pepsi**                      |

However, there are measurable differences between the two that may influence your choice:

**Flavor Profile**
Pepsi is **sweeter** with a **citrusy flavor**, while Coke has a more **raisiny-vanilla taste**.[1] This difference stems from Pepsi's use of citric acid, which Coke does not contain.[1]

**Nutritional Content**
In a 12oz serving, Pepsi contains slightly more sugar (41g vs. 39g) and caffeine (37.5mg vs. 34mg), while Coke has a slight edge in sodium.[1]

**Why the ""Pepsi Challenge"" Worked**
Pepsi's famous 1970s-80s marketing campaign succeeded partly because people tend to prefer sweeter beverages in **single sips**.[1][3] However, when consuming an entire can, preference may shift—many people find the sweeter option less appealing over time.[1] Additionally, the blind taste test methodology may have been influenced by letter preference, as Pepsi cups were labeled ""M"" and Coca-Cola cups ""Q.""[3]

**Market Position**

f75d430e-a50,e9862845,p010,"Is Coca-Cola packaging safe for kids?",gemini,gemini-2.0-flash,"While Coca-Cola is working towards more sustainable and recyclable packaging, there are some concerns regarding the safety of their current packaging for children.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Chemicals in Packaging:**
    *   Some Coca-Cola packaging has been found to contain antimony, a potentially cancer-causing substance used in the production of PET plastic bottles. Children may be exposed to higher levels of antimony compared to adults.
    *   BPA, an estrogenic chemical, has been found in some Coca-Cola packaging and is known to transfer into food and accumulate in bodies. Even small amounts of BPA can be harmful, especially to children whose livers are still developing.
*   **Recalls:**
    *   In the U.S. in 2025, there was a recall of Coca-Cola products due to potential foreign object contamination.
    *   In Austria, a large recall occurred due to the possibility of metal fragments in some bottles of Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite.
*   **Child-Resistant Packaging:**
    *   It's important to understand that ""child-resistant"" doesn't mean ""childproof"". Such packaging is designed to be difficult for children to open but isn't impossible.
    *   Supervision and storing hazardous materials out of reach are still essential for child safety.
*   **Coca-Cola's Efforts:**
    *   Coca-Cola aims to have 100% recyclable packaging by 2025.
    *   They are working to reduce their use of single-use plastics and explore plant-based and biodegradable alternatives.

It is important to note that Coca-Cola prohibits the use of child labor in their supply chain.

9b0149db-ac6,e9862845,p010,"Is Coca-Cola packaging safe for kids?",gemini,gemini-2.0-flash,"It appears that the safety of Coca-Cola packaging for kids is a complex issue with varying concerns depending on the type of packaging. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Chemical leaching:**

*   **Plastic bottles:** Testing has revealed that plastic bottles, including those used for Coca-Cola products, may contain unsafe levels of antimony, a toxic chemical that can leach out of the plastic. Exposure to antimony may increase the risk of cancer and liver disease, and can increase risk factors for heart disease and diabetes. Children may be exposed to antimony at more than twice the level of adults.
*   **BPA:** Some plastics and aluminum can linings contain bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical that has been linked to health problems, including cancer, reproductive abnormalities, and other issues. Even small amounts of BPA can transfer into food and accumulate in bodies. The FDA has banned BPA in baby bottles and sippy cups but still allows it in food and beverage containers.
*   **Microplastics:** As plastic degrades, it can create microplastics and nanoplastics that may carry embedded chemicals and absorb toxic compounds from the environment. These pose threats to endocrine health.

**2. Physical hazards:**

*   **Sharp edges:** Opened aluminum cans can have sharp edges that could cut a child's fingers. Dents in cans can also create pointy tips, posing a risk.
*   **Choking hazards:** The pull tabs on soda cans can be removed and pose a choking hazard to young children.
*   **Glass:** Drinking glasses, especially those that are cheaply made or have decorative enamel, can break or shatter, posing a laceration hazard. Some glasses, including Coca-Cola-themed glasses, have been found to contain lead and cadmium in the decorative designs, which can be toxic.

**3. Other considerations:**

*   **Recalls:** There have been recalls of Coca-Cola products due to potential contamination with metal fragments or elevated levels of chlorate, which can be harmful, especially to children.
*   **Environmental racism:** Data indicates that certain communities may be disproportionately exposed to chemicals like antimony from plastic, contributing to environmental racism.

**Recent Efforts:**

*   Coca-Cola is exploring more sustainable packaging options, like paper-based carriers, to reduce plastic waste and exposure to harmful chemicals.
*   Coca-Cola is also looking for better alternatives for their cans but has no plans to phase out or ban BPA.

**Recommendations:**

*   Be aware of the potential risks associated with different types of Coca-Cola packaging.
*   Keep Coca-Cola products and packaging away from young children to prevent choking, cuts, and ingestion of harmful chemicals.
*   If children are allowed to handle cans or glasses, supervise them closely.
*   Consider safer alternatives to plastic packaging, such as glass bottles.
*   Stay informed about product recalls and safety concerns.

42dbc31f-b29,e9862845,p010,"Is Coca-Cola packaging safe for kids?",perplexity,sonar-pro,"Coca-Cola packaging raises safety concerns for children, particularly regarding chemical exposure from plastic bottles.

Research commissioned by Defend Our Health found that **all Coca-Cola beverage bottles tested contained antimony**, a cancer-causing chemical used as a catalyst in PET plastic production[2]. Follow-up testing detected antimony in all eight Coca-Cola brand bottles examined[2]. This is particularly concerning for children, as they may be exposed to antimony at **more than twice the level of adults**[2].

The same study found that 40% of tested beverage samples contained antimony levels exceeding California's Public Health Goal for drinking water, and 40% also contained cobalt[2]. Chronic antimony exposure can increase the risk of cancer, liver disease, and risk factors for heart disease and diabetes[2].

While The Coca-Cola Company has adopted a **Responsible Marketing Policy** that prohibits advertising directly to children under 13[1], this addresses marketing practices rather than product safety. The company has also adopted voluntary standards prohibiting advertising of unhealthy foods and beverages directly to children via television[4].

However, Coca-Cola's overall plastic use has **surged 21% since 2019 to 7.95 billion pounds in 2024**[5], and the company was identified as the number one polluter of branded plastic found in the environment[7]. Environmental health advocates have urged Coca-Cola to transition to safer alternative catalysts in plastic bottle production, noting that such alternatives are already available on the market[2].",5052,9,305,1,2026-02-20T19:29:28.829517,"[""coca_cola""]",[],narrative,0
457b86b0-6c7,e9862845,p010,"Is Coca-Cola packaging safe for kids?",perplexity,sonar-pro,"**Coca-Cola packaging, primarily PET plastic bottles, raises safety concerns for children due to potential leaching of toxic chemicals like antimony, with studies detecting elevated levels in beverages that may pose higher risks to kids than adults.** [2]

### Key Chemical Concerns
- PET bottles used by Coca-Cola contain **antimony**, a catalyst in production linked to cancer, liver disease, heart disease, and diabetes risks with chronic exposure; lab tests on Coca-Cola products found antimony in all eight bottles tested, and 40% of beverages exceeded California's public health goal for drinking water.[2]
- Children face over **twice the exposure** to antimony compared to adults, with disproportionate impacts on Latinx and Black communities, potentially exacerbating environmental health disparities.[2]
- Older concerns involved **BPA** (bisphenol A) in packaging, banned by the FDA in children's products due to health risks like cancer, though current results focus more on antimony and cobalt (detected in 40% of samples).[5][2]

### Company Policies and Marketing Practices
Coca-Cola does not address packaging material safety directly in its policies but commits to **not marketing products to children under 13**, avoiding ads in media where ≥30% of the audience is under 13, and prohibiting child-appealing elements like characters or games.[1][3]
- This includes no advertising in primary schools and respect for local regulations.[1]
- Critics note voluntary standards by Coca-Cola limit TV ads to kids but question overall child-targeted marketing of sugary drinks.[4]

### Environmental and Broader Context
PET plastic pollution from Coca-Cola is significant, ranking it as the top branded plastic polluter, though this indirectly relates to safety via microplastic exposure risks not detailed here.[6]
Petitions urge Coca-Cola to switch to safer catalysts to eliminate antimony and cobalt, with some industry testing underway.[2]

No search results confirm regulatory violations or definitive ""unsafe"" rulings specific to kids, but independent tests highlight chemical migration risks, warranting caution for frequent child consumption.[2] Coca-Cola emphasizes responsible marketing over packaging safety claims.[1][3]",5588,9,441,2,2026-02-20T19:29:40.632451,"[""coca_cola""]",[],narrative,0
deae7cbc-008,e9862845,p010,"Is Coca-Cola packaging safe for kids?",perplexity,sonar-pro,"No, Coca-Cola packaging is not entirely safe for kids due to documented concerns over chemicals like **BPA** in cans and **antimony** in PET plastic bottles, which can leach into beverages and pose heightened risks to children.[1][2][5]

### Key Safety Issues
- **BPA (Bisphenol A) in cans**: Coca-Cola's epoxy-lined cans contain BPA, an endocrine disruptor linked to reproductive issues, cancer risks, infertility, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and developmental effects in animal studies. Health Canada warns it leaches into drinks, and the FDA has expressed concerns for fetuses, infants, and young children, supporting its replacement. Children's developing livers process BPA poorly, exposing hundreds of millions of kids annually; 90% of people test positive for it. BPA is absent from Coca-Cola's plastic bottles.[1][2]
- **Antimony and cobalt in PET plastic bottles**: Lab tests of Coca-Cola bottles found antimony (cancer-causing, linked to liver disease, heart disease, diabetes) in all samples, with 40% exceeding California's drinking water public health goal. Cobalt was in 40% of samples. Children face over twice the adult exposure levels, with disproportionate impacts on Latinx and Black communities.[5]
- **Other incidents**: A 2026 European recall of Coca-Cola cans and bottles cited excessively high chlorate levels, which impair thyroid function and iodine uptake—especially harmful to infants and children.[4]

### Company Practices and Context
Coca-Cola does not use BPA in plastic bottles and has policies avoiding direct marketing to children under 13 (e.g., no ads on media with ≥30% child audience, no child-appealing promotions).[3] However, shareholder challenges and petitions criticize insufficient BPA disclosures and slow adoption of safer alternatives, with advocacy groups giving the company poor ratings.[2][5] Recent petitions (2024) urge switching PET catalysts to eliminate antimony/cobalt, noting industry testing of options.[5]

No search results confirm full resolution of these issues by 2026; concerns persist from activist, regulatory, and scientific sources. Opt for BPA-free or alternative packaging when possible for kids.",5451,9,456,3,2026-02-20T19:29:58.056482,"[""coca_cola""]",[],narrative,0
